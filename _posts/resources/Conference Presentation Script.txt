Slide 2: Cyber Physical Systems

>While CPS is included in several critical sectors, such as power, nuclear plants, and 
urban infrastructures, these systems are often subtle to various cyber security threats 
due to several reasons. 

>First, these systems were not designed to be part of a public network, i,e, the Internet, 
they were in fact built and operated in a segregated and contained environment, this has 
changed over the past two centuries due to the need for remote operations as well as 
providing live and continuous support from various vendors. 

>In addition, these CPS are often equipped with IoT devices, many of these are low cost and 
low-performance devices that are designed with built-in security features. 

>As a result, several security concerns emerged about these critical systems

Slide 3: CPS Security Attacks

>Cyber security threats and attacks have been on the rise during the past decade. 
The advancement of technology in cyber-physical systems (CPS) has led to many advantages 
but also created several new advanced threats. 

>A real example would be the event known as the Estonia Blackout, which involved a series of 
cyber-attacks directed towards government entities such as ministries, financial institutions
, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and telecommunication land line systems. These attacks 
that targeted critical infrastructures caused a so-called “cyber blackout”, which 
effectively took down various online services including critical ones such as banking. 

>In 2017, Triton Malware was used to attack the petrochemical plant in the Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia (KSA) and caused it to shutdown to prevent an explosion.

>In 2010, the Stuxnet Worm attack an Iranian nuclear facility.  The Stuxnet worm is capable 
of seizing control of industrial plants. Some Western experts say its complexity suggests 
it could only have been created by a "nation state".

Slide 4: Fusion ApproachHoneypot and Darknet

Slide 5: Proposed Big Data Fusion Approach

Slide 6: General Project Information

>Analyzed Data: 18 months
>Number of Monitors: 92 (46 Honeypot sensors, and 46 Darknet sensors)
>Data Volume: 100 GB
>Activities originated from 150 countries.


Slide 7: Preliminary Results (Targeted Services)

>Description the columns
>Describe Findings (IPMI)
>What is IPMI
>Modbus as de facto for SCADA

Slide 8: Preliminary Results (Focused on Honeypot Dataset)

>IPMI has been found critical in the majority of its communication

>BACnet is distributed almost equally between medium and high severity. 

>The majority of S7Comm communication has been found high in terms of severity.

>Modbus traffic are distributed between high and critical, with majority to the latter. 

>Our investigation reveals that IPMI has probably the most targeted attacks not just in 
terms of numbers, but also severity. 

>Furthermore, the lack of critical severity label within BACnet and S7Comm is because 
these services run on top of UDP.  As such, no connection setup and data exchange. 

>Modbus has been found to be the only CPS service that has all variants of attack severity 
(maybe because running on top of TCP )

Slide 9: Discussions and Limitations 

>Collaboration between different entities 
>Access the critical infrastructure 
>Getting approval/authorizations 
>Dataset used is limited to the scope we cover and the duration (period) of our analysis. 
>Almost impossible to assess the real attack impact (damage) on physical infrastructure 
without having one. 
>Identifying and filtering between benign and malicious data in systematic and automated 
manners are done manually.  

Slide 10: Conclusion

>Big Data fusion model that leverages a correlation engine.
>Utilized two types of trap-based network monitoring systems, namely, Honeypot and Darknet. 
>The Honeypot data are found to be more stable than darknet. 
>The Darknet, though are more attractive monitors to hackers and easier to secure and hide. 
>The IPMI is the number one targeted CPS service (among the top conventional darknet 
abused services)

Slide 11: Future Work

>Automating Internet scanners’ IP addresses filtering 
>Investigating larger and more recent dataset 
>Integrating our solution with physical testbed 
>Leveraging machine learning techniques to predict future attacks
